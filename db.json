      "description": "I took on this project after i came across an instagram post showcasing a really sweet chat application based off of the Kik platform. I decided it would be a great oppurunity to jump back into dealing with user authentication and database persistance. I had some trouble dealing with the persistance for the chat messages and so i decided just use firebase as it was a simple and small app",

Each interval is known as a pomodoro. I built this app so i could have a custom made version of the pomodoro timer in hopes that it would improve my efficiency and time management when working on other projects. I will eventually be converting it to a mobile app using React Native.",
